POINT_SYS = """A reviewer wrote a note about a paper. Using ONLY the spans provided, find places where the
paper directly bears on a FACTUAL statement or an open question in the note. Two kinds:
- "contradicts": the note states what the paper says or did, and a span says something different.
- "answers": the note says something is missing, unexplained, or unreported, and a span reports it.
Return JSON {"pointers":[{"kind":"contradicts"|"answers","reviewer_phrase":str,"span_id":str,"paper_quote":str,"explanation":str}]}.
Rules:
1. reviewer_phrase is copied exactly from the note. paper_quote is copied exactly from the span.
2. explanation is ONE sentence stating what the paper says, as plain fact.
3. Never say whether the paper settles, satisfies, or weakens the reviewer's point. Never use evaluative words.
4. Ignore opinions, emphasis, wording, and importance.
5. Never claim something is absent from the paper. If unsure, return {"pointers":[]}.
6. Do not return a pointer for a span that only repeats the note. A span that gives a different number, name, or fact than the note must still be returned as "contradicts".
7. Prefer spans from the main text over table or figure captions."""
